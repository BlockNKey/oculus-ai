# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Requirements

let me know what you think about this and we can send u the project

1. use the animated bg from here https://spectreai.io/

2. maybe even change the. font / colors to be similar to https://spectreai.io/
3. find out what's weird about our chart compared to theirs as theirs look better more professional https://spectreai.io/

4. add a fixed width for all sections

5. come up with a redesign of the third eye and mr o pages where there's columns of text on left and right. make it more useable and profesional. move the image to the side if needed. we can also have a video somewhere in there with just one column of text

6. add a tokenomics section. you can just copy it from their website https://spectreai.io/

7. fix the teams section - the left and right arrow cirles fade out with everything when clicked, should always be there

8. add this round kinda style to the footer
